	<h1>Savory Favorites</h1>
		<p>A savory food has a salty or spicy flavor rather than a traditional sweet flavor when baking. The saltiness of the food is pleasing to the sense of taste or smell especially by reason of effective seasoning. In other countries such as Britain and Italy, they consider savory foods as a small dish that is designed to "clear the palate" before or after a main entree.</p>
