	<h1>Cookie Dough Basics</h1>
		<p>When dough is made at home, common ingredients include flour, eggs, butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract,and salt. Along with a basic dough recipe, there are many things you can add to the dough to change the flavor profile. Things such as spices or extracts will change the taste of the dough as one. However, mix ins such as chocolate chips, m&m's, candy bars or even fruits add more of a texture to the cookie.</p>
